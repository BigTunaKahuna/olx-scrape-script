# olx-scrape-script
A web script to scrape the website olx made in python.

You can change the "base" for everything you want to search on olx and scrape it. For example if I wanted to search for dogs I would have needed "https://www.olx.ro/animale-de-companie/animale-de-companie/bucuresti/q-catei/". To simplify some things you can just apply some filters and then start scraping since this will make the process shorter. To get the page variant simply go to at  least page 2 and notice how the link changes and change the range based on how many pages you have/need since on overflow it will simply default to the maximum page and copy the same content over and over until the for loop is done. As an example the page variant for dogs looks like this "https://www.olx.ro/animale-de-companie/animale-de-companie/bucuresti/?page=3".
