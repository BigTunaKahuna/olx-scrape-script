# olx-scrape-script
A web script to scrape the website olx made in python.

You can change the "base" for everything you want to search on olx and scrape it. For example if I wanted to search for dogs I would have needed "https://www.olx.ro/animale-de-companie/animale-de-companie/bucuresti/q-catei/". To simplify some things you can just apply some filters and then start scraping since this will make the process shorter.
